# MilesToFeet

This is a mini app that converts miles to feet. I also decided to add an option to convert it to the inches.

# How it Works

When the you run the application, you will be prompted to choose whether you would like to convert miles to feet or inches.

Once you confirm and add your input, the application will return the converted value.
